Here's a breakdown of Payment Gateways, Payment Processors, and Card Networks:

### 1. Payment Gateway
A Payment Gateway is a technology that facilitates the transfer of payment information from the customer's end (e.g., an online shopping cart) to the payment processor or acquiring bank. It's responsible for securely transmitting sensitive payment details and often provides features like fraud detection.

#### Key Roles:
- Data Encryption: Ensures that payment information (like credit card details) is securely transmitted between the customer, merchant, and banks.
- Authorization: Sends the transaction details to the payment processor or acquiring bank for approval.
- Integration: Connects with e-commerce platforms, point-of-sale (POS) systems, and shopping carts.
  
#### Examples:
- PayPal
- Stripe
- Authorize.Net
- Braintree
- Razorpay

### 2. Payment Processor
A Payment Processor is a service that handles the back-end process of moving money from the customer’s bank account or credit card to the merchant’s account. It works closely with card networks and acquiring banks to ensure that transactions are processed correctly.

#### Key Roles:
- Transaction Handling: Processes the payment from the customer's bank account or credit card to the merchant's bank.
- Funds Transfer: Moves money from the customer's account to the merchant's account after the transaction is approved.
- Fees Deduction: Typically takes a small fee for processing the payment, which may include a percentage of the transaction amount plus a fixed fee.
  
#### Examples:
- Worldpay
- Square
- Adyen
- First Data
- Chase Paymentech

### 3. Card Networks
A Card Network (also known as a card scheme) is a network that facilitates transactions between the merchant's bank and the customer's bank. It is responsible for routing the transaction to the correct issuing bank and managing the rules and protocols that govern card payments.

#### Key Roles:
- Transaction Routing: Routes the payment information between the payment processor and the issuing bank (the customer's bank).
- Standards and Protocols: Establishes the rules for how transactions are processed, including fees, chargebacks, and security protocols.
- Interchange Fees: Card networks often charge interchange fees, which are paid by the acquiring bank to the issuing bank.

#### Examples:
- Visa
- Mastercard
- American Express
- Discover
- UnionPay (China)
- JCB (Japan)

### How They Work Together:

1. Customer Purchase:
   - A customer makes a purchase using a credit or debit card. The payment details are entered either online or at a POS terminal.

2. Payment Gateway:
   - The payment gateway securely transmits the customer's payment information to the payment processor. It may also perform initial checks, like fraud detection, before forwarding the data.

3. Payment Processor:
   - The payment processor receives the transaction data from the payment gateway and sends it to the appropriate card network for authorization.
   - The card network communicates with the customer’s bank (issuing bank) to check if the funds are available and if the transaction can be approved.

4. Card Network:
   - The card network routes the transaction details between the payment processor and the issuing bank.
   - The issuing bank approves or declines the transaction based on the customer's account status.

5. Payment Processor:
   - If the transaction is approved, the payment processor facilitates the transfer of funds from the issuing bank to the acquiring bank (the merchant's bank).

6. Merchant Receives Funds:
   - The merchant receives the funds, minus any fees deducted by the payment processor and card network. This typically occurs within a few business days.

7. Customer Receives Confirmation:
   - The payment gateway sends a confirmation to the merchant and customer, completing the transaction.

### Summary:

- Payment Gateways: Facilitate the secure transmission of payment information between customers and merchants.
- Payment Processors: Handle the actual processing and transfer of funds between banks.
- Card Networks: Manage the routing of transactions between banks and set the rules for how card payments are processed.

These three components work together to ensure that electronic payments are fast, secure, and reliable for both customers and merchants.
