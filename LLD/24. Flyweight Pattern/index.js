// The **Flyweight Design Pattern** is a structural pattern that aims to minimize memory usage by sharing as many data structures as possible with similar objects. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to create a large number of objects that have some common characteristics. Instead of creating a separate object for each instance, the Flyweight pattern allows you to share common data among objects and only store unique data separately.

// ### Key Concepts

// 1. **Flyweight:** An interface or abstract class that declares methods for working with shared and unique data.

// 2. **Concrete Flyweight:** A class that implements the `Flyweight` interface and provides methods to handle shared and unique data.

// 3. **Flyweight Factory:** A class that manages the creation and reuse of `Flyweight` objects. It ensures that shared `Flyweight` objects are created and reused efficiently.

// 4. **Client:** The part of the system that uses `Flyweight` objects. It interacts with `Flyweight` instances via the `Flyweight` interface.

// ### Real-Life Examples

// 1. **Text Rendering:**
//    - **Scenario:** Consider a word processor that needs to display a large amount of text with various fonts and sizes. Each character might use the same font, but the text layout and formatting are unique.
//    - **Flyweight Use:** The Flyweight pattern can be used to create a shared font object (flyweight) and a unique character formatting object (extrinsic state). This way, the font is shared among many characters, reducing memory usage.

// 2. **Game Development:**
//    - **Scenario:** In a game, you might have many instances of a character type or graphical element, like trees or buildings, all of which share common attributes but have different positions or states.
//    - **Flyweight Use:** The Flyweight pattern can be applied to manage shared graphical elements (e.g., tree type) and unique attributes (e.g., position, size) separately. This minimizes the number of objects created and reduces memory consumption.

// 3. **Geometric Shapes:**
//    - **Scenario:** Suppose you have a graphical application that handles numerous shapes like circles, squares, and triangles. Many of these shapes might use the same outline color and pattern but have different sizes and positions.
//    - **Flyweight Use:** The Flyweight pattern can be used to share common outline colors and patterns among shapes while storing unique size and position data separately.

// ### Detailed Example: **Text Rendering**

// Let’s implement a simplified example of the Flyweight pattern for rendering text, where characters share common font information.

// 1. **Define the Flyweight Interface (`Character`):**

//    This interface defines the methods for working with characters, including rendering and storing shared and unique data.

//    ```typescript
//    interface Character {
//        render(font: string): void;
//    }
//    ```

// 2. **Create Concrete Flyweight (`ConcreteCharacter`):**

//    This class implements the `Character` interface and stores shared data, such as the character itself.

//    ```typescript
//    class ConcreteCharacter implements Character {
//        private readonly character: string;

//        constructor(character: string) {
//            this.character = character;
//        }

//        public render(font: string): void {
//            console.log(`Rendering character '${this.character}' with font '${font}'`);
//        }
//    }
//    ```

// 3. **Create the Flyweight Factory (`CharacterFactory`):**

//    This class manages the creation and reuse of `Character` objects. It ensures that characters are shared efficiently.

//    ```typescript
//    class CharacterFactory {
//        private static readonly characters: Map<string, Character> = new Map();

//        public static getCharacter(character: string): Character {
//            if (!this.characters.has(character)) {
//                this.characters.set(character, new ConcreteCharacter(character));
//            }
//            return this.characters.get(character)!;
//        }
//    }
//    ```

// 4. **Using the Flyweight Pattern:**

//    Here’s how you can use the Flyweight pattern to render text efficiently.

//    ```typescript
//    class FlyweightPatternDemo {
//        public static main(): void {
//            const text = 'hello world';
//            const font = 'Arial';

//            // Render each character using Flyweight pattern
//            for (const char of text) {
//                const character: Character = CharacterFactory.getCharacter(char);
//                character.render(font);
//            }
//        }
//    }

//    // Run the FlyweightPatternDemo example
//    FlyweightPatternDemo.main();
//    ```

// ### Explanation

// 1. **Flyweight Interface (`Character`):** Defines methods for rendering characters. This allows for interaction with different types of characters while abstracting away the details of shared vs. unique data.

// 2. **Concrete Flyweight (`ConcreteCharacter`):** Implements the `Character` interface and contains shared data (the character itself). The rendering method uses this data along with the external `font` information.

// 3. **Flyweight Factory (`CharacterFactory`):** Manages a pool of shared `Character` objects. It creates new characters only if they don’t already exist, ensuring that characters are reused efficiently.

// 4. **Client Code (`FlyweightPatternDemo`):** Demonstrates the use of the Flyweight pattern to render a string of text. It retrieves shared character objects from the factory and uses them to render the text efficiently.

// ### Why Use the Flyweight Pattern?

// 1. **Memory Efficiency:** By sharing common data among objects, the pattern reduces memory consumption. This is especially useful when dealing with large numbers of similar objects.

// 2. **Performance:** Reducing the number of objects created and stored improves performance and reduces the overhead of managing numerous instances.

// 3. **Separation of Concerns:** The pattern helps in separating shared and unique data, allowing for better organization and management of object attributes.

// 4. **Flexibility:** It allows for dynamic addition of new types of flyweights and management of shared resources without changing the existing system.

// ### Summary

// The Flyweight Design Pattern is used to efficiently manage large numbers of objects that share common characteristics. By separating shared data from unique data and managing the creation and reuse of shared objects, it reduces memory usage and improves performance. In text rendering, for instance, it allows for efficient management of character objects by sharing common font information and only storing unique data as needed.
