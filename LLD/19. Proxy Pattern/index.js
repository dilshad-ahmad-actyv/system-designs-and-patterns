// The Proxy Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides an intermediary or placeholder for another object. This intermediary (the proxy) controls access to the original object (the real subject), which can help with various concerns like access control, lazy initialization, logging, or managing resource usage.

// ### Simple Explanation

// Imagine you have a **library** with a **large book** collection. You want to borrow a book, but fetching it from the storage is time-consuming. Instead of directly fetching the book every time you want to read it, you have a **library assistant (proxy)** who helps with the process.

// Here's how it works:

// 1. **Book (Real Subject):** This is the actual book you want to read. It takes time to retrieve from storage.
// 2. **Library Assistant (Proxy):** This is a helper who manages access to the book. It keeps track of whether the book is already fetched or not. It only fetches the book when you ask to read it for the first time. After that, it just gives you access to the already-fetched book.

// ### Key Components

// 1. **Book (Real Subject):** The actual book that you want to read.
// 2. **Library Assistant (Proxy):** The intermediary who handles the book-fetching and providing access.

// ### Real-Life Example

// Let’s break it down with a simple code example:

// 1. **Book (Real Subject):**

//    ```typescript
//    class Book {
//        private title: string;

//        constructor(title: string) {
//            this.title = title;
//            this.loadFromStorage();
//        }

//        private loadFromStorage(): void {
//            console.log(`Fetching book: ${this.title} from storage.`);
//        }

//        public read(): void {
//            console.log(`Reading book: ${this.title}`);
//        }
//    }
//    ```

// 2. **Library Assistant (Proxy):**

//    ```typescript
//    class LibraryAssistant {
//        private book: Book | null = null;
//        private title: string;

//        constructor(title: string) {
//            this.title = title;
//        }

//        public read(): void {
//            if (this.book === null) {
//                this.book = new Book(this.title);
//            }
//            this.book.read();
//        }
//    }
//    ```

// 3. **Client Code:**

//    ```typescript
//    class LibraryDemo {
//        public static main(): void {
//            const assistant = new LibraryAssistant('The Great Gatsby');

//            // The book is fetched from storage only when read() is called for the first time
//            assistant.read(); // Output: Fetching book: The Great Gatsby from storage. Reading book: The Great Gatsby

//            // Subsequent calls to read() do not fetch the book again
//            assistant.read(); // Output: Reading book: The Great Gatsby
//        }
//    }

//    // Run the LibraryDemo example
//    LibraryDemo.main();
//    ```

// ### How It Works

// 1. **When you first ask the Library Assistant to get the book,** it will fetch the book from storage (this simulates the time-consuming operation).

// 2. **After the book is fetched,** the Library Assistant keeps a reference to it. 

// 3. **For any subsequent requests to read the book,** the Library Assistant just provides the already-fetched book without needing to fetch it again.

// ### Benefits of the Proxy Pattern

// - **Efficiency:** The book is only fetched once, saving time and resources.
// - **Control:** The Library Assistant controls access to the book, handling any additional tasks or checks.

// ### Summary

// The Proxy Design Pattern is like having a helper who manages access to a resource. In our example, the Library Assistant (proxy) controls the access to the Book (real subject). It fetches the book only when needed and provides efficient access for future requests. This way, you don’t waste time fetching the book multiple times.


// The Proxy Design Pattern itself does not directly involve any specific technology like Redis or cache storage, but it can be used in conjunction with caching mechanisms to manage access to resources efficiently. Let's clarify this relationship:

// ### Proxy Design Pattern and Caching

// **Proxy Pattern:** 
// - It provides a way to control access to an object by using an intermediary (proxy).
// - The proxy can handle additional concerns such as lazy initialization, access control, logging, and more.

// **Caching:**
// - Caching involves storing copies of frequently accessed data to improve performance and reduce retrieval time.
// - Redis, Memcached, and similar technologies are used for caching data in memory to speed up access.

// ### How They Work Together

// When the Proxy Pattern is used in conjunction with caching, the proxy can leverage caching mechanisms to optimize resource access. Here's how this integration might work:

// 1. **Proxy Manages Cache:**
//    - The proxy can check if the requested resource is already in the cache before attempting to load it from the original source.
//    - If the resource is not in the cache, the proxy fetches it, stores it in the cache, and then provides it to the client.

// 2. **Caching in Proxy Implementation:**
//    - The proxy can be designed to use a caching layer (e.g., Redis) to store and retrieve objects. 

// ### Example Using Redis as Cache

// Let’s extend the previous example to include caching with Redis:

// 1. **Setup a Simple Proxy with Caching:**

//    First, ensure you have Redis and a Node.js client library for Redis (like `ioredis`).

//    ```typescript
//    import Redis from 'ioredis';

//    // Initialize Redis client
//    const redis = new Redis();

//    class CachedLibraryAssistant {
//        private title: string;

//        constructor(title: string) {
//            this.title = title;
//        }

//        public async read(): Promise<void> {
//            const cacheKey = `book:${this.title}`;
//            const cachedBook = await redis.get(cacheKey);

//            if (cachedBook) {
//                console.log(`Reading book from cache: ${this.title}`);
//            } else {
//                // Simulate fetching the book from a time-consuming operation
//                const book = new Book(this.title);
//                book.read();
               
//                // Cache the result
//                await redis.set(cacheKey, 'cached', 'EX', 3600); // Cache for 1 hour
//            }
//        }
//    }
//    ```

// 2. **Example Usage:**

//    ```typescript
//    class LibraryDemo {
//        public static async main(): Promise<void> {
//            const assistant = new CachedLibraryAssistant('The Great Gatsby');

//            // The first call will fetch the book and cache it
//            await assistant.read(); // Output: Fetching book: The Great Gatsby from storage. Reading book: The Great Gatsby

//            // Subsequent calls will read from the cache
//            await assistant.read(); // Output: Reading book from cache: The Great Gatsby
//        }
//    }

//    // Run the LibraryDemo example
//    LibraryDemo.main();
//    ```

// ### Summary

// - **Proxy Design Pattern:** Provides an intermediary to manage access to an object, which can be extended to include additional functionalities like caching.
// - **Caching:** Involves storing frequently accessed data to speed up retrieval. Technologies like Redis are commonly used for caching.
// - **Integration:** The proxy can utilize caching mechanisms to optimize access to resources by checking and updating the cache as needed.

// By combining the Proxy Pattern with caching, you can efficiently manage and access resources, leveraging both design principles to improve performance and control.
