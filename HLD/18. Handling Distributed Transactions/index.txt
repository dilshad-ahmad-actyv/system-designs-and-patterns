What is Transaction
 - It's refer to a set of operations which need to be performed or simply say a group of tasks which need to be performed against the DB.

 It has 4 properties (ACID):
  - Atomicity - All operations in a single transaction should be success or all should fail.
  - Consistency - DB should be in consistent state before and after transactions.
  - Isolation - More than one transaction that is running concurrently, appears to be serialized.
  - Durability - After transaction successfully completed, even if DB fails, the Data should not get lost.
