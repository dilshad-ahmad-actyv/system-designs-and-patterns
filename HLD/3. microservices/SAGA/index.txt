Data Management in microservices
- Database for each services -> SAGA(It solves ACID problems) and CQRS(it solves Join problems)
- Shared database for all services - Negative part is Scalability.

SAGA - Sequence of Local Transactions -> Event based updation 
     - Rollback -> failure events -> based deletion

SAGA 
 - Choreography
 - Orchestration
